# Creating Maps in Python Using U.S. Data Products

Various agencies across the United States (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau, HUD, etc.) provide a wealth of data products that can be used to understand various aspects of the American population. These data products allow us to learn more about U.S. demographics, the economy, housing, etc. This repository is a collection of code meant to serve as examples of how one can use data from the U.S. Census Bureau to create some interesting spatial visualizations in Python. 

Each script in the ```code``` foler is meant to create different visualizations. You can reach and execute each script by itself, but if you want to run all of these scripts at once, you can simply run ```execute_code.py```

## Data Products Used
- American Community Survey
- Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics - Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)

## In Progress
- U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development - Low Income Housing Tax Credit
- Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council - Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) Data
